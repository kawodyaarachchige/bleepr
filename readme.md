# Chat App _ Bleepr

This is a simple chat application built with React, TypeScript, and Firebase. It allows users to send real-time messages and share images in the chat.

## Features

- **Real-time messaging**: Messages are instantly displayed to all users without needing to refresh the page.
- **User authentication**: Users can sign in using **Email/Password** or **Google login** (Google login is still in progress).
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload and share images (Note: Firebase Storage has a free limitâ€”see details below).
- **Implemented Image Upload Functionality**: The feature is coded and ready, but I havenâ€™t upgraded the Firebase plan to avoid risks. So, feel free to update your own Firebase plan if needed. ðŸ˜…
- **UI Components**: Styled using ShadCN, a modern design system for building consistent and responsive UIs.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
